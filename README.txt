The FileField Role Limit module is an extension of CCK FileField module and 
adds the capability to limit the max upload file size for each different role.

The Filefield Role Limit module create new settings for each FileField field 
to define single file upload max size or the whole uploaded files size in a 
single node.
Different limit values can be provided for each role and the module will 
automatically switch to default FileField max upload size behavior if no 
settings per role are provided.

The Filefield Role Limit module works also with ImageField module.
